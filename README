prl: new rate limiter with parallelized transmit path

(if you have suggestions for a better name, please let me know :-))

prl is a simple, low-overhead token bucket rate limiter with a
parallel transmit path.  The goal is to retain HTB functionality as
much as possible, except its performance hit.

These rate limiters were originally designed for the EyeQ project [1]
and is now stripped out as a standalone kernel module.  Right now,
it's not a qdisc, but we'll get there eventually, hopefully as a
drop-in replacement for htb.

Design doc to come soon, but if you want to play with it, just type
"make" and it should build a kernel module newrl.ko.

To insert: insmod newrl.ko rate=1000 dev=ethx

Right now, the above command (see main.c) creates a static
configuration with 1 root rate limiter and 1 leaf, attached to root,
with a static rate limit of 1000 Mb/s.  Since it uses netfilter, it
will rate limit ONLY IP traffic exiting via ethx.

User-space configuration will be available soon.

You can check /proc/prl_stats to see some statistics about the rate
limiters.  It will show per-cpu queue occupancies, number of tokens,
and also the hierarchy.
